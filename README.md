# What I Was Looking For

This project is a personal learning journey into **Unity game development**.

I am using this small indie game to learn Unity step by step, while trying to bring a strong narrative idea to life through gameplay, atmosphere, and exploration.

## Concept

The game takes place in a **silent, frozen, post-apocalyptic world**.

You play as a **wanderer**.  
You don’t know who you are, where you are, or what you are looking for.

The game begins with you waking up next to a small fire, inside an abandoned building.  
You have a backpack with basic supplies and tools, as if you have been traveling for a long time — but you don’t remember why.

When you leave the building, you don’t exit through a door, but through a window.  
The lower floors are buried under snow. Outside, there is only ice, frozen streets, and buildings half swallowed by winter.

There are **no people, no creatures, no voices**.

Only remnants of lives that once existed.

By exploring houses, towns, and abandoned places, the player uncovers small fragments of stories left behind — traces of families, routines, and final moments.  
Each discovery slowly hints at the world’s collapse and at the wanderer’s own forgotten purpose.

The game is intentionally quiet, melancholic, and open to interpretation.

## Gameplay & Style

- 2D **pixel art**
- **Top-down / angled camera** (RTS-like perspective)
- Movement in all directions (not a side-scroller)
- Light survival elements (supplies, inventory weight, preparation)
- Exploration-focused, story-driven experience
- Minimal UI, atmosphere over action

## Project Goal

This project exists primarily to:
- learn **Unity**
- understand 2D game architecture
- practice clean code, structure, and version control
- experiment with narrative design through environment and exploration

The scope is intentionally kept small and flexible.

## Status

Early development / learning phase.  
The project will evolve gradually as I learn more about Unity and game development.
